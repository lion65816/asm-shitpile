; Set these!!!
;=================

	; For a general time conversion formula:
	; 60 frames = ~1s.
	; Convert 60 from decimal to hexadecimal using the calculator in Windows for example...
	; 60 = $3C.

	!TimeToWait = $3C
	; The time spent waiting.
	; By default, it's $3C (60 frames, 1 second).

	!TimeToFire = $5A
	; The time spent firing
	; By default, it's $5A (90 frames, 1.5 seconds.)

	!TimeToReturn = $3C
	; The time spent buffering before returning to the waiting period.
	; Basically Wait 2: Electric Boogaloo.
	; By default, it's $3C (60 frames, 1 second).
	; The total waiting value is (TimeToWait + TimeToReturn),
	; so keep that in mind to properly adjust it!

;=================
; Define
;=================

; Sprite specific RAM
	!GFXPointer = !C2				; GFX Pointer. See GFXPointMirror.
	!StatusFlag = !151C				; Sprite Phase flag. $00 - Waiting to Fire, $01 - Firing, $02 - Return to Waiting.
	!LoopCounter = !1528			; Loop Counter. Holds the Loop Counter value to later be used in the GFX routine.
	!DrawGFX = !1534				; Draw GFX call flag. $00 - Don't draw, $01 - Draw.
	!Timer = !154C					; Phase duration timer. Times the frames spent in phase 1 (waiting to fire), phase 2 (firing) and phase 3 (returning to waiting)
	!Direction = !157C				; Direction to fire flag. $00 - Down, $01 - Up.

; Scratch RAM for Draw Routine
	!FramePointer = $02				; Used to help Vertical Flip every other frame.
	!TileAmount = $03				; Used to determine Tile Amount without relying on Loop Counter.
	!YFlipIndex = $04				; Direction Flag Mirror. Used as the Index to tell whether the graphics should be Vertically Flipped or not.
	!YPosIndex = $05				; Loop Counter Mirror #1. Used as the index for the Y Position of the tile in the graphics routine.
	!LoopCounterMirror = $06		; Loop Counter Mirror #2. Used as a Loop Counter for the GFX Routine.
	!GFXPointMirror = $07			; GFX Pointer Mirror. Used as an aid for the tile tables, to draw the correct set of graphics.
